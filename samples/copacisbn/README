A simple project to query copac for a specific ISBN and ask for an XML record in the search response.

Dumps the xml record out to the console

Build the executable jar file with "mvn package"

run with "java -jar target/copac-1.0-SNAPSHOT.one-jar.jar"

(Should work, if not "java -jar target/copac-1.0-SNAPSHOT.one-jar.jar com.k_int.sample.CopacClient")
