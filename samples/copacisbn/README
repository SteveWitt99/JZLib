A simple project to query copac for a specific ISBN and ask for an XML record in the search response.

Dumps the xml record out to the console

Build the executable jar file with "mvn package"

run with "java -jar target/copac-1.0-SNAPSHOT.one-jar.jar"

(Should work, if not "java -jar target/copac-1.0-SNAPSHOT.one-jar.jar com.k_int.sample.CopacClient")



Important stuff to note:

* It's hacked together from some other code, it aint pretty!

* It uses the maven2 onejar plugin to build a single executable jar file and make life easy, but you should probably do proper dependency management if using it in a live project

* Thare are a couple of .property files in the src/main/resources directory that are critical to everything working (Maps oids to human readable names etc) If you do your own build, make sure they get into the classpath

* I've commented out the code for dumping marc and grs records... I'm too old and lifes too short to be doing this in java any more.. Groovy is your friend ;)
